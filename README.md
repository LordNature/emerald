Decent ~~terrible~~ blog written in Crystal.
### Usage ~~why would you?~~
This blog is written on **Crystal** which requires you to have a development environment that can compile the shards, etcetera.
You can figure this part out yourself. If you do not know how to do it, well do some googling.
### Req
* SassC if you want to compile the .sass file in to a css file.
* Crystal, obviously.
* Shards or invoke ``crystal deps``
